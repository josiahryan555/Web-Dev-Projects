# Web-Dev-Projects
These were homework projects for my Web Development class (CS336) with professor Victor Norman at Calvin University in 2022.

Projects 1-7 were done in bare html, javascript (or typescript), and CSS.
*To Run:*
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Find the folder in your file system
3. Open in your browser (hopefully named something helpful like index.html)

Projects 8-10 and my [Final Project](https://github.com/jryanb0b/personal-website) were done in Angular.
*To Run:*
1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open your terminal or powershell at the folder of the project you wanna see/open.
3. Enter: `npm install`.  This will download all the necissary node package modules to support this code.
4. Enter: `ng serve`. This will host this wepage on a port of your computer so you can see it in your browser.  Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
